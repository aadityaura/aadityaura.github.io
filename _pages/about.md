Hi there, Iâ€™m Aaditya (Ankit), a Senior Research Engineer specializing in NLP, Deep learning, and Machine learning. My research aims to develop machine learning methods in the Healthcare & Life Sciences domain.

I currently work at [Saama](https://www.saama.com/), conducting research to accelerate [clinical trials and reduce drug development timelines](https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/how_a_novel_incubation_sandbox_helped_speed_up_data_analysis_in_pfizer_s_covid_19_vaccine_trial). My research interests involve Representation Learning on Graphs, Generative language models, Federated learning, XAI and their applications in Healthcare data.

I've been honored to contribute meaningful research and datasets that have been adopted by leading companies like [Facebook AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09085) (Galactica), [Google AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617) (Med-PaLM, Med-PaLM-2), [Microsoft, and OpenAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375) (GPT-4) to further responsible advancements in AI.

Recently, I developed [OpenBioLLM-70B & 8B](https://huggingface.co/aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B), the most capable openly available Medical-domain LLMs to date. These models have demonstrated impressive performance, [outperforming industry giants like GPT-4, Gemini, Meditron-70B, Med-PaLM-1, and Med-PaLM-2](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5f3fe13d79c1ba4c353d0c19/_SzdcJSBjZyo8RS1bTEkP.png) in the biomedical domain. It's been incredibly rewarding to see OpenBioLLM-70B deliver SOTA performance and OpenBioLLM-8B surpass GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Meditron-70B. Notably, [OpenBioLLM is the first medical model to trend among the world's top 10 LLM models](https://x.com/aadityaura/status/1786453127442640917) on the Hugging Face front page and the [first Indian LLM](#) to appear on the trending page.

I had the honor of spearheading a collaboration with the Hugging Face team and Prof. [Pasquale Minervini](https://x.com/PMinervini) to develop the [open-medical LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openlifescienceai/open_medical_llm_leaderboard), which serves as the standard evaluation benchmark for medical domain LLMs. Additionally,  I had the privilege of presenting the [first medical domain hallucination benchmark](https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-1.21/), suggesting methods to identify and mitigate hallucinations in the medical domain.

Currently, my focus is on [Multimodal Medical & Genomic LLMs](#) and robust evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.

I have a deep appreciation for open-source work and contribute to projects including Tensorflow, Pytorch Geometric and HuggingFace. In December 2022, I noticed structured output issues in large language models and developed [Promptify](https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify), which received encouraging feedback on GitHub and assisted relief efforts during the [Turkey-Syria earthquake](https://dev.to/erayg/how-an-open-source-disaster-map-helped-thousands-of-earthquake-survivors-afetharitacom-440). During COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, I initiated a project to capture cough and breath sounds via phone to [classify COVID-19 coughs using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02417), with the aim of aiding doctors in rapid pre-screening of patients.

If you are still reading, here is more about me: Apart from my research life, I'm drawn to activities like Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu and Chess. I enjoy spending time in nature, Observation, and Philosophy. I have realized to some extent that everything is connected; there is neither good nor bad; there is neither positive nor negative. I often displace myself away from social noise, take a seat, and try to see, observe, rather than just looking at it. In the process, I naturally learn.

Note: I am looking for a funded PhD opportunity, especially if it fits my Responsible Generative AI, Multimodal LLMs, Geometric Deep Learning, and Healthcare AI skillset.
